# password_generator

* What's Included

This is a random password generator that will output a random combination of characters.

* How It Works

When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they will be shown a series of prompts that they answer along with a prompt for selecting password length. Once all of the prompts have been answered, the website will generate a random combination of their selected characters. This can then be copied and pasted elsewhere.

* Files included

index.html
script.js
style.css
images folder

* Notes to Grader

I continued to update this after it was submitted so please keep me informed with which version the grade reflects. This was a very difficult assigment for me so I am looking forward to reading the constuctive criticism in order to improve on what I have done so far.
